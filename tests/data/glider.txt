In Australia, that land of strange animals lives the greater glider, an animal as strange as any of them. Zoologists describe it as a "hairy mammal", which means that it has fur and that its young feed upon milk from the mother. They say it is "viviparous"; its young are born alive, not hatched from eggs. Also they call it a "marsupial": The young live in the mother’s pouch for four months and then spend some time clinging to her back.

The greater glider looks somewhat like a squirrel with a long tail. Fully grown, the greater glider is one to one and a half meters in length. By spreading its front arms and hind legs, it opens up a flying membrane that enables it to glide. It does not flap its wings like a bird. Usually, it launches itself from a high tree and sails through the air as much as a hundred meters or more, often with a baby in its pouch or on its back. If it lands low on a tree or on the ground, it hastily scrambles up to another high place for a takeoff.

The greater glider is not seen in zoos or outside of Australia because of another unusual characteristic: It only eats the tender leaves and blossoms of the eucalyptus — the gum tree so common in Australia, so rare in most other places.

There are flying mammals in many parts of the world. Most common are bats and flying foxes that beat their wings, and flying squirrels that do not. There are, it happens, other flying marsupials in Australia, the pygmy acrobat and the sugar (or honey) gliders that are also found in Tasmania and New Guinea. These can glide for distances up to fifty meters. However, the pygmy, appropriately named, is only five to eight centimeters long; and the sugar gliders are about the size of a large squirrel (which they strongly resemble). The uniqueness of the greater glider among flying mammals is due to its size and the distance it can glide.
