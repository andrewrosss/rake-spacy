Comets are objects that exist in space and have captured our imagination for thousands of years. Comets are made up of ice, dust and small particles; and they travel around the sun which sometimes makes them look like they have a strange appearance. The word comet comes from the Greek language and means "stars with hair".

The most well known one is called Halley's Comet. It is fifteen km long and it travels around the Sun every two hundred years. Halleyâ€™s Comet can be seen from the Earth every 75 years and it will next appear in 2061. It was given its name by the astronomer Edmond Halley.
