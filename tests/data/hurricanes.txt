A hurricane, also called a tropical cyclone, is the most powerful storm that forms on earth. A hurricane forms over warm ocean water and as it grows in size and intensity, its powerful winds begin rotating around a center area, like water going down the drain. Because of the physics phenomena known as the Coriolis Effect, hurricanes that form in the Northern Hemisphere feature winds that move counter clockwise, while those that form in the Southern Hemisphere feature winds that move clockwise.

The centre of a hurricane is called its eye. In the eye, air may sink rather than rise, which in turn suppresses cloud formation, leading to calm skies in this area of the hurricane. The size of the eye of a hurricane can be up to 240 miles in diameter but is normally between 20 and 40 miles in diameter. The clouds on the edge of the eye form the eye-wall of the hurricane, which typically feature the hurricane's strongest winds, highest clouds, and fiercest precipitation.

When a storm's winds reach 39 mph, it becomes a tropical storm, and as the storm continues to expand, and its winds reach 74 mph, it is called a hurricane and will receive a name such as Hurricane Katrina. A hurricane can extend hundreds of miles from the centre of the hurricane. The most powerful hurricanes can sustain winds of over 156 mph. When hurricanes hit land, they cause: Massive damage, storm surges, major water damage, rogue waves and flooding. Once they hit land however they quickly weaken, as they are no longer being powered by warm ocean water.
