Puppies are born with a lot of challenges. They are born deaf, blind, toothless and without their sense of smell. They begin to see and hear at nine days old and can smell at twenty-days. Their sense of smell very quickly grows to be one thousand times stronger than a human.

There are five million puppies born each year. This is compared to four million babies born during the same amount of time. A puppy is thought of as an adult dog at the age of three, or twenty-one in human being terms.
